# Hardware
The aim of this project is to have a standalone device, either portable or
fixed, which will control LMS. In some ways, similar to the original
[Logitech Controller](https://lyrion.org/players-and-controllers/squeezebox-controller/),
bit with the added capability of being able to scan barcodes containing sufficient
information to correctly select the desired track, album, or playlist.
